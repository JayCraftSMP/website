### I am younger than 18, am I allowed to apply?
No. This server is 18+ only.

### How long is a planned "season"?
A season goes on for as long as we decide it goes for but the general guidelines have been that we run a season until next update. We usually aim for the 1.X.1 update were there's been some bug fixes and such for a smoother experience.

### Do you offer a world download at the end of the season to your members?
Yes!

### Are any server events "mandatory"?
No, while we do organise server events like for example killing the Ender dragon or similar they're not mandatory. We're going for a more relaxed and laid back play style.

### Are camera accounts allowed? And/or Freecam?

Yes, camera account and freecam is allowed!

### Are communal farms allowed?

Yes. Communal farm as allowed but not enforced. It is up to whomever builds a farm to decide if they want to share it or not. In previous seasons the enderman XP farm have been pretty much 100% communal and people have added anvils, library and enchantment tables and such as they saw it fitting and even stocked up with lapiz. But again, there's no enforcement of communal farm.

### Is there a world border, and if so how large?

Yes, there's a world border but it's sat at default max size. There's millions of blocks to explore if you so like but please be considerate of chunk generation for lag reasons.

### Are players free to build where they want? Can they claim space for their build?

Essentially people are allowed to build wherever they want but we tend to respect each other and not build too close to others bases without first asking if it's OK. Again, we don't enforce anything but being friendly and practicing courtesy.

### Is the world seed known to players? Or kept secret to keep things interesting? And do you pick the seed, or go random?

The world seed is known. It's fairly easy to calculate the world seed by exploring the bedrock either way. I pick a seed and have tended to go towards something similar to a large island sort of spawn region but you are free to roam around as you please.

### Do you pregenerate chunks?

Yes, we pregenerate an area of 10 000 blocks in a radius around 0, 0!

### Do you have a social media?

Yes, please look us up at [Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/jaycraft) or [X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/JayCraftSMP). We also have a [YouTube Channel]()!
